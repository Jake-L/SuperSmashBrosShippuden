The idea of this game is to knock your enemies off the screen. Each time you attack them, their damage will increase, 
which is indicated at the bottom of the screen. The more damage someone has taken, the further they will go flying 
when you hit them. If you get knocked off the stage, remember to jump back on right away. Each match lasts two minutes,
and will then display each player's score. You earn points each time you get a kill, and lose points each time you die.  

If only one player selects a character, a computer controlled character will appear to fight them.
